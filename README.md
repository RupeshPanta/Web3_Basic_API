# Goal
This is a simple Rest API that has CRUD functionality. I created this using python, flask, HTML and SQLite portable database resource. The reason I  used python to create this api was as I am going to make Simple KanBan App for final Project using again Python, HTML, flask and MySQL database. So, I could make use of this API for final Project too. The app  has a simple front end as a login form. 
 

# Simple REST API
- Flask rest api (CRUD)
    - [x] Post ---> Create
    - [x] Get  ---> REAd
    - [x] Put ----> Update
    - [x] Delete --> Delete
- Real time modification with api
- Postman for API (Download postman)

# Run flask app
```bash
Go to app.py file
open terminal
type export FLASK_APP=app
type export FLASK_ENV=development
type flask run
server should run on localhost/5000 by default
open postman and send api request
```
