# Goal
This is a simple API that has CRUD functionality. I created this using python, flask and HTML. The reason for using python to create this api was as I am going to make Simple KanBan App for final Project using again Python, HTML and flask. So, This API will be helpful for my final Project. It has a simple front end.
 





## How to run 

# Simple REST API
- Flask rest api (CRUD)
- Real time modification with api
